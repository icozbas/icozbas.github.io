    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      This is a personal academic website. It does not offer commercial services, user accounts, or advertising.
      The site is designed to be low-data and privacy-respecting.
    </p>

    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      This website uses <strong>Cloudflare Web Analytics</strong> to understand high-level traffic trends
      (for example: page views, referrers, and broad device categories).
      Cloudflare states that its Web Analytics does not use cookies or localStorage and does not fingerprint individuals for analytics purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical logs and security</h3>
    <p>
      Like most websites, basic technical data may be processed to deliver the site and protect it against abuse
      (for example: IP address, user agent, request metadata, and security-related signals).
      This data is used for reliability and security, not for profiling.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      This website does not intentionally set analytics or advertising cookies.
      Some cookies may still be set in limited cases by infrastructure components for security or strictly necessary functionality.
      Where cookies are used, they are intended to be strictly necessary and not for advertising.
    </p>

    <h3>Data sharing</h3>
    <p>
      Site traffic and security processing may involve Cloudflare as a service provider.
      I do not sell personal data.
    </p>
